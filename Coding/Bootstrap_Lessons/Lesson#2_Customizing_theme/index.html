		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p class="align">
			The proverb ' Knowledge is Power ' is as  true today as it was in the past. in fact, it is knowledge that distinguishes man from animals.
			Man is physical weaker than many animals. He cannot run fast as fast as a panther. He cannot see as far as an eagle can. His sense of smell
			is weaker than that of a dog.  He can not carry as heavy loads as some beasts of burden do. He cannot fight tigers and lions with his bare hands.
		</p>
		<p class="align">
			Yet he has managed to become the most powerfull creature on earth. His power comes from knowledge, not from physical strength.
			Man has the ability to acqure knowledge , preserve it in books and thus pass it on to the coming generataions.
			This has given him the power the control the forces of nature , and use them for his benefit. It is, however,
			necessary for man kind to use this knowledge and power wisely. If we use our knowledge wisely, we can create a better
			and safer world than the world of today.
		</p>
		<p class="align">
			With the help of  knowledge, the man discovered, invented and learned many things. He invented many things to improve
			transportations like vans, ships, airoplanes, train etc.With the help of knowledge man has discovered the secrets of matter.
			Man turned in to energy and most usefull form of energy is atomic energy and electricity.Means of communication, means of
			tansportation and invented of new and best medicines, all these things are due to the knowledge.
		</p>
		<p class="align">
			Knowledge and power alone cannot bring happiness to mankind. Unfortunately, we have not used our knowledge
			for the benefit of entire mankind. Those persons and nations who happened to possess knowledge and power in
			the past used it for creating personal and national empires by conquering more lands and enslaving more people.
			Our knowledge has not enabled us to banish war that has plagued man from the very beginning. In reality,
			we have used the immense knowledge acquired in the past two or three centuries to make war more and more
			horrible and devastating. The present century that has seen man reaching the moon, and exploring the deep
			space has also seen two world wars in which millions of people were killed. It has also seen the United State
			of America dropping the most horrible weapon of war, the atomic bomb, on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. These wars were
			stated by western nations who pride themselves on bieng the most advance and civilized nations of fthe world.

			<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in active " id="Webdesign">
				<p class="align ">Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
					The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised
					code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization.</p>
				<p class="align">
					The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side)
					design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader
					scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role
					involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines
				</p>
			</div>
			<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Webdevelopment">
				<p class="align ">
					Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet
					(World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the
					simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications,
					electronic businesses, and social network services.
				</p>
				<p class="align ">
					A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design,
					web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network
					security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually
					refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most recently
					Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. These CMS can be
					made from scratch, proprietary (such as Open Text) or open source (such as Drupal).
				</p>


			</div>
			<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Webcustomization">
				<p class="align ">
					Personalization, also known as customization, consists of tailoring a service or a product to accommodate
					specific individuals, as opposed to general groups. A wide variety of organizations use personalization to
					improve customer satisfaction, as well as for advertising. Personalization is a key element in social media
					and recommender systems.

				</p>
				<p class="align ">
					Web pages can be personalized based on the characteristics (interests, social category, context, etc.)
					of an individual, therefore providing them with a tailored user experience. The term customization is
					often used when the site only uses explicit data such as product ratings or user preferences.

				</p>
				<p class="align ">
					Technically, web personalization can be achieved by associating a visitor segment with a predefined action.
					Customizing the user experience based on behavioral, contextual and technical data is proven to have a
					positive impact on conversion rate optimization efforts. Associated actions can range from changing the
					content of a webpage, presenting a pop-in or even triggering a personalized email.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Multimedia">
				<p class="align ">
					Multimedia refers to content that uses a combination of different content forms. This contrasts with media
					that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced
					material. Multimedia includes a combination of text, audio, still images, animation, video, or interactive content forms.
				</p>
				<p class="align">
					Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, dynamic, interacted with or accessed by information
					content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.

				</p>
				<p class="align ">
					Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content.
					Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art; by including audio, for example, it has a broader scope.
					The term "rich media" is synonymous for interactive multimedia. Hypermedia scales up the amount of media content in multimedia application.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Optimizations">
				<p class="align">
					In mathematics, computer science and operations research, mathematical optimization (alternatively,
					optimization or mathematical programming) is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criteria)
					from some set of available alternatives.
				</p>
				<p class="align">
					In the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by
					systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function.
				</p>
				<p class="align">
					The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations comprises a large area
					of applied mathematics. More generally, optimization includes finding "best available" values of some
					objective function given a defined domain (or a set of constraints), including a variety of different
					types of objective functions and different types of domains.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="seo">
				<p class="align">
					Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page
					in a search engine's unpaid results - often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results.
					In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears
					in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may
					target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search,
					news search and industry-specific vertical search engines
				</p>
				<p class="align">
					As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the
					actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by
					their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated
					coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing
					activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links,
					is another SEO tactic.

		Windows Holographic is a mixed reality computing platform by Microsoft, enabling applications in which the live
		presentation of physical real-world elements is incorporated with that of virtual elements (referred to as "holograms"
		by Microsoft such that they are perceived to exist together in a shared environment. A variant of Windows for augmented
		reality computers (which augment a real-world physical environment with virtual elements) Windows Holographic features an
		augmented-reality operating environment in which any Universal Windows App can run. In addition, with Holographic APIs
		, which are part of the Universal Windows Platform, and supported as standard in Windows 10 (including versions for mobile
		devices and Xbox One), mixed reality features can be readily implemented in any Universal Windows App, for a wide range of
		Windows 10-based devices.
	</p>
	<p class="align">
		Microsoft announced Windows Holographic at its "Windows 10: The Next Chapter" press event on January 21, 2015.
		It is set to be introduced as part of the general rollout of Windows 10, through the smart glasses headset
		Microsoft HoloLens. The Windows 10 launch began July 29, 2015 with release of the PC version, with HoloLens to
		be released within the next year.
	</p>
	<p class="align">
		The premier device for Windows Holographic, Microsoft HoloLens is a smart-glasses headset that is a cordless,
		self-contained Windows 10 computer. It uses advanced sensors, a high-definition stereoscopic 3D optical head-mounted
		display, and spatial sound to allow for augmented reality applications, with a natural user interface that the user
		interacts with through gaze, voice, and hand gestures. Codenamed "Project Baraboo," HoloLens had been in development
		for five years before its announcement in 2015, but was conceived earlier as the original pitch made in late 2007 for what
		would become the Kinect technology platform.
	</p>
	<p class="align">
		The Microsoft HoloLens design is of a visor glasses unit connected to an adjustable padded inner headband.
		The unit can be tilted up and down, as well as adjusted forward and backward in relation to the headband.
		To wear the HoloLens, the user uses an adjustment wheel at the back of the headband to secure it around the crown
		of their head, supporting the weight of the unit. The user then tilts the visor down in front of the eyes.
		The release version of HoloLens is projected to weigh around 0.4 kg.

	<h2 class="hololens">Career Counseling</h2>
	<p class="align career1">
		Career counseling and career guidance are similar in nature to other types of counseling, e.g. marriage or
		psychological counseling. What unites all types of professional counseling is the role of practitioners,
		who combine giving advice on their topic of expertise with counseling techniques that support clients in
		making complex decisions and facing difficult situations. The focus of career counseling is generally on
		issues such as career exploration, career change, personal career development and other career related issues.
	</p>

	<p class="align ">
		There is no agreed definition of career counseling worldwide, mainly due to conceptual, cultural and linguistic
		differences. This even affects the most central term counseling (or: counselling in British English)
		which is often substituted with the word guidance as in career guidance. For example, in the UK,
		career counseling would usually be referred to as careers advice or guidance. Due to the widespread
		reference to both career guidance and career counseling among policy-makers, academics and practitioners
		around the world, references to career guidance and counselling are becoming common
	</p>

	<p class="align">
		Career counseling or career guidance includes a wide variety of professional activities which help people
		deal with career-related challenges. Career counselors work with adolescents seeking to explore career options,
		experienced professionals contemplating a career change, parents who want to return to the world of work after
		taking time to raise their child, or people seeking employment. Career counselling is also offered in various
		settings, including in groups and individually, in person or by means of digital communication.
	</p>
	<div id="jobs"></div>
	<p class="align">
		Several approaches have been undertaken to systemize the variety of professional activities related to career
		guidance and counseling. In the most recent attempt, the Network for Innovation in Career Guidance and
		Counselling in Europe (NICE) - a consortium of 45 European institutions of higher education in the field
		of career counseling - has agreed on a system of professional roles for guidance counselors. Each of these
		five roles is seen as an important facet of the career guidance and counselling profession.
