As we know security can turn out to be a critical issue , so our system will be using biometric device for authentication.<br> Biometric systems are the methods which make identification of people according to their physical characteristics. Biometric methods consist of fingerprint , face, hand shape, retina, iris, and voice track methods.<br>These methods may be used alone or together in the developed systems. Fingerprint recognition method and ID system in biometric methods are frequently preferred because applications of them are easy and low-cost , the leading method too.</p><h1>Team Members</h1><br><p class='developersname'>Zain Ansari<br><br>Qazi Kafeel Alam<br><br>Shahzaib Noor<br><br>Saim Ahmed<br><br>Affan Tariq</p> ";
